# Project Objective : Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App using Deep Learning    
# Dataset : [Click here for Dataset1](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) [Click here for Dataset2](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).     
# Motivation :   
learning and understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks    

# Pipeline for Project :   
* First thing in this pipeline is recognition algorithm for both humans and dogs and then classify it by giving out the exact name of breed.
